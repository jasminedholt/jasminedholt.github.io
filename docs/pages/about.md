nice to meet you! i am majoring in media studies & art at pomona college and take an intersectional approach to everything i study and create as a queer, korean american. whether it is through publishing, design, education, or any other means of production and outreach, i am passionate about uplifting individual voices and underrepresented communities with a focus on empathetic design and unconventional storytelling.
<br/><br/>
my c/v is linked below to view my past work experiences but feel free to explore this site to learn more about my personal endeavors and practices. outside of professional activities, you can find me foraging for different materials to make paper, dye, and tea. also, i enjoy reading creative fiction, playing the fiddle, and indulging in conversations with random strangers!
<br/><br/>
if you happen to be searching for a driven creative who is both independent and has strong collaboration skills, email me at <a href="mailto:jdha2021@mymail.pomona.edu"><span style="color:darkorange">jdha2021@mymail.pomona.edu</span></a> with any kind of inquiry! :)
