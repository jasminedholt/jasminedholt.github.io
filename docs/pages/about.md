<p style="line-height:1.8">
nice to meet you! my name is jasmine (they/them/theirs), and as a media studies & art major at pomona college, i take an intersectional approach to everything i study and create as a queer, korean american. whether it is through publishing, design, education–or any other means of production and outreach–i am passionate about uplifting individual voices and underrepresented communities with a focus on empathetic design and unconventional storytelling. 
<br/><br/>
outside of school and work, you can find me foraging for different materials to make paper, natural dyes, and tea. also, i enjoy reading creative fiction, playing the fiddle, and indulging in reflective conversations over cozy beverages! feel free to explore the rest of this site if you are curious about my various personal endeavors and artistic practices.
<br/><br/>
if you happen to be searching for a driven creative who is both independent and has strong collaboration skills, email me at <a href="mailto:jdha2021@mymail.pomona.edu"><span style="color:darkorange">jdha2021@mymail.pomona.edu</span></a> with any kind of inquiry! :)
